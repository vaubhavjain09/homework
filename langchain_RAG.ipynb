       "' \\nImportant disclosures and certificati ons are contained from page 9 of this report. https://research.danskebank.com  \\n    \\n   \\n  \\nThe overall theme for markets this week continued to be  the scaling back of \\nexpectations of rate cuts  especially in the US as the economy looks stronger, and inflation \\nhigher, than expected. However, the change should not be exaggerated. Inflation \\nexpectations are well in line with targets and indicators for banking activity in both the US \\nand Europe confirm that the current stance of monetary policy is having a dampening effect \\non economies. \\nThe latest significant upside surprise to US data was the January CPI . The core price \\nindex rose 0.4% m/m, so clearly more than what is compatible with 2% annual inflation. \\nThe increase was driven by a broad -based increase in service prices. The so -called “super \\ncore” index of services excluding shelter rose 0.85% m/m. This  likely reflected higher than \\nnormal January price adjustments to make up for past cost increases in businesses and so \\nis not likely to be repeated to the same extent in coming months, bu t nevertheless feeds into \\nconcerns in the Fed and elsewhere that a tight labour market and high wage growth could \\nmake it difficult to get service inflation down far enough.  \\nOn the negative side, US retail sales declined 0.8% in January  and were revised down \\nfor December, and industrial production declined 0.5%. Especially retail sales is a highly \\nvolatile data series though, and these numbers do not really change the view on the US \\neconomy. \\nIn Europe, the economic news has been slightly more positive this week. Employment \\ngrowth in the euro area actually accelerated in Q4  to 0.3% q/q. The labour market \\nusually reacts with a lack to the economy, so it is perhaps not surprising that the stagnating \\nEuropean economy has not yet produced a decline in jobs, but accelerating outright growth \\nin employment is harder to explain. Sur veys continue to show a large, unmet demand for \\nlabour among euro area companies. The strong labour market reduces pressure  on the ECB \\nto cut rates and adds to concerns about a potential rebound in inflation from high wage \\ngrowth. The German ZEW index showed a new increase in business expectations in \\nFebruary consistent with the view of a more positive global situation for man ufacturing, \\nalthough assessment of current conditions actually worsened.  \\nUnlike in the US, UK inflation was lower than expected in January, which helped \\ndampen market worries globally . Core CPI increased just 0.16% m/m seasonally \\nadjusted, and service prices dragged down. On the other hand, wage growth declined less \\nthan expected in December and stands at 6.2% y/y, while the unemployment rate declined \\nfrom 4.0% to 3.8%. With core infla tion still as high as 5.1% y/y, we still expect the Bank \\nof England to be cautious in cutting rates.  \\nNext week, on Thursday, we will get February PMI data for most major economies . \\nThey could show a renewed strengthening in global manufacturing.
